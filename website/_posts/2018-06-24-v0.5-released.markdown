Now including maps and stats!

If you have already installed the extension it should update soon, if not you can get it
from the [Chrome WebStore]({{ site.data.webstore.webstore-running-challenges-link }}) today!

It has been a couple of months since our last release, but we haven't been
twiddling our thumbs in that time...

The two big features in this version are the addition of maps to most challenges
(with regionnaire being the biggest exception, but more on that later), and the
inclusion of a brand new section at the top summarising lots of stats to get your
inner geek salivating!

### Stats

The stats are displayed above the challenges, and just under the athlete stats
that are provided by default on the parkrun website. Here we summarise some of
the main pieces of information that parkrun tourists and stats geeks love to have,
such as:

 - How many different events have I actually attended?
 - What is the total distance I have run?
 - What percentage of parkruns attended have been parkrun events I haven't been to before?
 - What is the total travel distance between each of the parkrun events I have done?


[![Stats are now available]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/stats.png "Stats are now available"){: .center-image}]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/stats.png)

Most of the stats are available on everyone's page, which means that you can
browse these details for other people just like on your own page, but there are
are a few exceptions. If you have configured your home parkrun and athlete ID in
the extension's options page, then you will also get two additional stats to
answer the questions:

- What is the nearest event I haven't done yet?
- Which is the furthest away parkrun event I have been to?


### Maps

Many of the challenges involve visiting specific parkruns - many are based on their
name (e.g. the initial letter, or containing a word), but there are also those
such as the Cowell Club that look for number of unique events. To help see where
you have been, and perhaps help you find where are the closest parkrun events to
help you complete a challenge, there are now maps to help you.

[![Maps are now available]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/maps.png "Maps are now available"){: .center-image}]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/maps.png)

There are 3 main types of icon on the map:

- Green rounded markers indicate events you have already been to, and qualify for
the challenge in question.
- Orange pentagonal markers indicate the closest set of events needed to complete
the challenge.
- Blue square markers indicate qualifying events, just incase you happen to be
somewhere on holiday, or further afield on a given weekend, and want to help progress
a particular challenge towards completion.

The fourth type of marker is purple, and indicates your home parkrun. If you have
run it, and it counts in the challenge it will be round, and if you need to run it
it will be pentagonal, as per the list above. If the home parkrun fits none of these
categories it is still displayed on your page, but will be a star shape.

If you visit someone else's page, the purple marker will be missing entirely, as
the home parkrun will be unknown.

If you are looking at your own page, then the Orange pentagonal markers are displayed
automatically in the "Nearest Qualifying Events" layer. If you are on someone else's
page (or have not set your home parkrun in the options), then we cannot automatically
tell what the home parkrun is, so all qualifying events appear in the "Other Qualifying Events"
layer, which is not selected by default.

N.B. The "Other Qualifying Events" layer can slow things in your browser where
there are a lot of eligible parkruns, e.g for the "Cowell Club", where any event
is fair game!

If you have any feedback, good or bad, feel free to email us!

### Regionnaire Challenge

The eagle eyed among you will have noticed that the Regionnaire challenge hasn't
got a map yet - well, we are still working on that, as it is the hardest one to
display it in a good way, and we wanted to get the rest of the maps out for feedback
whilst we worked on that more tricky problem!
