Now with Firefox support!

Quite a few of you have been waiting for this, so we are pleased to announce
that there is now a version of the Chrome extension available for Firefox! Firefox
add-ons are very similar to Chrome extensions and we were able to convert the bits
of code that weren't compatible into something that works in both browsers.

Publishing a Firefox add-on also has the added bonus of being available for
Firefox for Android automatically - that's right, Running Challenges has now gone
mobile! The astute among you will notice that it is only Firefox on Android
that is supported - add-ons are still not allowed on Apple mobile iOS devices,
but just like the Chrome extension, it will work on a Mac laptop/desktop browser.

### Where do I get it?

Running Challenges has been submitted to the Firefox Add-ons website, which you
can find here: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/running-challenges/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/running-challenges/).

### What if it doesn't work?

We think it will work fine, but if it doesn't, please email us and tell us as
much as possible about what you were doing when something went wrong, and what
environment you were in, e.g. what version you installed, what browser version
you are using, and what configuration you had set, what URL you tried to load
etc...
