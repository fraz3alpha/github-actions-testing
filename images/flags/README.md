# Flags

## Adding a New Country Flag

To add a new flag an appropriately sized rendering of the version from the
[Twemoji project on GitHub](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) is required.

The simplest way to get to a 256x256 px png file is to go to [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/)
and find the flag of choice, e.g. [Malaysia](https://emojipedia.org/flag-for-malaysia/) and
view the 240x240 px Twitter image and save that. You can then open it in Gimp and
resize the canvas to 256x256 and centre the resultant image.
